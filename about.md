Hi, there. I'm Sachoco.

I've been working as a web developer here in the Flatland (The Hauge, the Netherlands), and it's been such exciting cause in every project I learn new stuffs.

I most of the time carry out a lot of researches and trial and error process, looking for the best solution (at that moment).

So, I thought "Hey, why don't I share my dev note?".

It might help some people who encounter the same kind of problem and also it shows a part of my working process which is otherwise invisible. 

Hope you find this blog helpful.
